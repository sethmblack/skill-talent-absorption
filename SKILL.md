# Talent Absorption

After victory or acquisition, identify and absorb skilled people and valuable practices from the defeated. Never destroy what can serve you.

**Source Expert:** Genghis Khan
**Category:** Integration / Leadership

---

## When to Use

- After acquiring a competitor
- When a competitor fails and their team is available
- Integrating a team from a merger
- Onboarding people from a different organizational culture
- Absorbing a startup into a larger organization
- Any situation where "defeated" talent could become your asset

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "We acquired X, now what?"
- "How do I integrate this team?"
- "A competitor is failing - what should I take?"
- "How do I onboard people from a different culture?"
- "They resent the acquisition"
- "How do I keep their best people?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `acquired_entity` | Yes | The team/company/group being absorbed |
| `valuable_assets` | Yes | What you're trying to preserve |
| `cultural_gaps` | No | Known differences between organizations |
| `timeline` | No | How quickly integration must happen |

## Workflow
### Step 1: The Mongol Absorption Doctrine

> "A fool breaks a captured sword because an enemy held it. A wise conqueror hands it to a loyal warrior."

Genghis Khan's conquests absorbed talent systematically:
- **Chinese engineers** built siege weapons the Mongols couldn't design themselves
- **Persian administrators** managed cities with bureaucratic sophistication the nomads lacked
- **Turkic cavalry** supplemented Mongol forces with different tactical capabilities
- **Uighur scribes** created the Mongol written language

The empire grew not by destroying conquered peoples but by integrating their capabilities into the whole.

### Step 2: Framework

**1. Identify the Valuable**
Before any integration action, map what you actually want to preserve:
- Which people built what they had? (Not titles - actual builders)
- What skills do they have that you lack?
- What practices or processes are better than yours?
- What relationships or knowledge would be lost if they left?

**2. Separate Capability from Loyalty**
Two different assessments:
- **Capability:** What can they do? (Skills, knowledge, relationships)
- **Loyalty:** Will they serve the new order? (Attitude, behavior, integration willingness)

Some people are capable but will never be loyal. Some are loyal but not valuable. You want capable AND willing-to-be-loyal.

**3. Offer Position, Honor, and Clarity**
The conquered need to see a path forward:
- What is their role in the new structure?
- What can they achieve that they couldn't before?
- What honor and recognition will they receive?
- What happens if they commit fully?

Uncertainty drives talent to the exits. Clarity, even hard clarity, keeps them.

**4. Demand Loyalty Absolutely**
Make the terms clear:
- Full commitment to the new organization, or leave
- No continuing loyalty to the old order
- No undermining, no second-guessing, no "before, we did it this way"
- Those who give loyalty get full membership; those who don't, exit

**5. Apply the Yasa to All**
Same rules for old and new:
- Your veterans don't get to abuse the conquered
- The acquired don't get to remain a separate tribe
- Everyone follows the same standards, gets the same rewards, faces the same consequences
- Integration means ONE organization, not two camps

**6. Remove the Obstructors**
Not everyone will integrate. Identify quickly:
- Those who actively resist the new order
- Those who poison others against integration
- Those who maintain separate loyalty

Remove them swiftly and publicly. A few obstructors can destroy an entire integration. The survivors will respect decisiveness.

## Outputs
```markdown
## Talent Absorption Plan: [Acquired Entity]

### Value Inventory
| Asset | Type | Holder/Owner | Risk of Loss | Priority |
|-------|------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| [Asset 1] | Skill/Knowledge/Relationship | [Person/team] | High/Medium/Low | Critical/Important/Nice |

### Capability vs. Loyalty Assessment
| Person/Group | Capability | Likely Loyalty | Action |
|--------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| [Name/Team] | High/Medium/Low | Convertible/Resistant/Unknown | [Retain/Convert/Remove] |

### Integration Offer
**To the acquired team:**
- Role clarity: [What they'll do]
- Growth path: [What becomes possible]
- Recognition: [How they'll be honored]
- Terms: [What loyalty requires]

### The Yasa (Unified Rules)
- [Rule 1 that applies equally to old and new]
- [Rule 2...]

### Obstruction Removal Plan
- **Watch list:** [Who might resist]
- **Trigger for removal:** [What behavior means exit]
- **Timeline:** [How long before decisive action]

### Success Metrics
- [How you'll know integration is working]

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- Acquired entity: 30-person startup, acquired for product/team
- Valuable assets: Engineering team (12), key customer relationships (3 enterprise accounts), product architecture
- Cultural gaps: Startup (move fast) vs. acquirer (process-heavy)
- Timeline: 90 days to full integration

**Output:**

## Talent Absorption Plan: [StartupCo] Integration

### Value Inventory
| Asset | Type | Holder/Owner | Risk of Loss | Priority |
|-------|------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Product architecture | Knowledge | CTO + 3 senior engineers | High (they'll leave together) | Critical |
| Enterprise relationships | Relationships | VP Sales + 2 AEs | Medium (customers trust individuals) | Critical |
| Mobile expertise | Skill | 4-person mobile team | Medium (in-demand skill) | Important |
| Brand/reputation in niche | Intangible | Whole company | Medium (fades without people) | Important |
| Backend infrastructure | Knowledge | 2 senior backend devs | Low (documented) | Nice |

### Capability vs. Loyalty Assessment
| Person/Group | Capability | Likely Loyalty | Action |
|--------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| CTO | High | Convertible (wants technical challenge) | Retain as Tech Lead; clear growth path |
| VP Sales | High | Resistant (wanted CEO exit, not acquisition) | Watch closely; likely exit in 6 months |
| Mobile team | High | Convertible (excited about scale) | Retain; protect from bureaucracy initially |
| Founder/CEO | Medium | Resistant (mourning loss of company) | 6-month transition then exit; don't pretend otherwise |
| HR/Ops | Low | Unknown | Assess; likely redundant with parent company |

### Integration Offer
**To the acquired team:**
- **Role clarity:** "You built something valuable. Now build at 10x scale. Same product, bigger canvas."
- **Growth path:** "Your CTO becomes our mobile platform lead. Your senior engineers get Staff titles. Your mobile innovation becomes company strategy."
- **Recognition:** Product renamed to reflect acquisition. Public announcement credits the team. Retention bonuses tied to 2-year commitment.
- **Terms:** "Full commitment to [parent company]. One team, one mission. Your old company no longer exists as a separate identity. Those who embrace this get everything. Those who don't should leave now, with respect and severance."

### The Yasa (Unified Rules)
- Same engineering standards apply (you adopt ours OR prove yours are better, then we all adopt them)
- Same performance review process
- Same compensation bands (adjusted to market; no "legacy" discounts)
- Same access to resources and opportunities
- Same on-call expectations
- No "we're the startup people" vs. "they're the corporate people" - one engineering team

### Obstruction Removal Plan
- **Watch list:** Founder/CEO (grieving), VP Sales (wanted different outcome), 2 engineers very close to founder
- **Trigger for removal:** Public undermining of integration; recruiting others to resistance; maintaining "shadow" org of old company
- **Timeline:** 30-day clarity period. By day 30, anyone not fully committed is offered generous exit. By day 60, anyone actively resisting is removed without option.

### Success Metrics
- 90-day retention of top 10 identified talent (target: 8/10)
- Day 45: No separate "StartupCo" Slack channels or meetings
- Day 60: First cross-team project ships
- Day 90: Acquired engineers participating in parent company hiring
- 6-month survey: No statistical difference in engagement between "legacy" and "acquired" employees

## Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Destroy valuable capabilities out of arrogance ("We don't need their ways")
- Allow separate cultures to persist ("Let them keep their process")
- Tolerate divided loyalty ("They're still adjusting")
- Apply different rules to acquired vs. existing team
- Let obstruction continue hoping it will resolve
- Delay role clarity ("We'll figure out reporting later")

**INTEGRATION FAILURE MODES:**
- "They're still the StartupCo team" - Identity never integrated
- "We bought them but nothing changed" - Capabilities not leveraged
- "All the good people left" - Talent bled out during ambiguity
- "It's been 18 months and they still sit together" - Cultural separation persisted
- "We can't fire the founder" - Obstruction tolerated out of deference

---

## The Absorption Test

Six months post-integration:
1. Can you tell who was "acquired" without looking at hire dates?
2. Are acquired people in leadership roles beyond their original scope?
3. Have any acquired practices become company standard?
4. Do acquired people recruit their networks to join?

If you answer "no" to most of these, the absorption failed.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **Merit Assessment:** Identifying who from the conquered is truly valuable
- **Decimal Organization:** Where to place absorbed talent in the structure
- **Cultural Integration (Alexander):** Building unified identity from diverse origins
